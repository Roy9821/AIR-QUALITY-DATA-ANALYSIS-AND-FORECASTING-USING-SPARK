## Introduction

Air pollution is a global environmental concern with significant implications for public health and the environment. The "Air Quality Data Analysis and Forecasting using Spark" project leverages Apache Spark's distributed computing capabilities to perform advanced analytics and forecasting on air quality data. By analyzing historical data and utilizing machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide insights into air pollution patterns and generate accurate forecasts for future air quality conditions.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains sample air quality data sets for testing and development purposes.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for data preprocessing, analysis, and forecasting.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various aspects of the project, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and visualization.
- `docs/`: This directory contains additional documentation, references, and resources related to the project.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone [repository_url]
```

2. Install the required dependencies. This project may require the following dependencies:

   - Apache Spark: Install Apache Spark on your local machine. Refer to the official Apache Spark documentation for installation instructions.
   - Jupyter Notebooks: Install Jupyter Notebooks to run the provided notebooks. You can install it using `pip`:

     ```shell
     pip install jupyter
